# Airport-simulator

Project pitch.
My project is a air traffic control simulator that helps manage how planes move around a small(busy) airport without crashing into each other. I want to build a system where an AI handles most of the boring routing automatically, but the user can jump in whenever they want to take control and change a plane's path. It’s basically like a game where you try to keep everything running smoothly during "rush hour" by managing three different types of planes, ones landing, ones taking off, and ones just passing through the area to see if an automated system can actually make the airport more efficient.



Primary users:
This product is for people who like simulation games or are interested in how air traffic control works. It could be a good tool for students learning about best pathing for planes routes and with the use of automation trafice, they could learn how ai is able to do it.


Features:
1)Radar display- it is the main screen that shows aircraft positions, flight paths, and critical data like speed and destination
2)Aircraft Data- it show unique flight id, alittude, speed 
3)Conflict Alerts systen: An alarm that flashes red if two planes are about to get too close to each other.
4)Automated ai pilot- response for following the flight plan and listening to air traffic controller. also would have a small chance of not listening to the atc(air traffice controller)
5)User overide - Users can click a plane to manually change its heading or altitude to avoid a crash.
6)Plane automatically spawining-  planes automatically enter the airspace( planes entering airspace either have a landing   


Benefits:
1)Safety traning:- Users will get to learn how to spot potential crashes before they happen using the alert system.
2)Traffice handling- The AI handles the repetitive flying, so the user only has to worry about fixing the most dangerous situations
3)Learn best routing skills
